A quick readme written mostly by AI, will update when possible

Update: 2025-07-16 I've replaced pillow with exiftool and made changes to the GUI. This is slower but the exif data is more complete.  I'll provide a better readme at some point.



Trashes Panda ‚Äî Android Trash Database Parser & EXIF Extractor
===============================================================

üß† What This Tool Does
----------------------
Trashes Panda is a forensic utility designed to extract and enrich metadata from Android's trash system. It processes ZIP archives containing the `trash.db` database and associated image files (typically from Samsung Gallery or similar apps), and outputs a detailed CSV report with timestamps, EXIF data, and file metadata.

üìÅ How Android's `trash.db` Works
---------------------------------
On many Android devices (especially Samsung), when a user deletes a photo, it is not immediately removed from storage. Instead:

- The image is moved to a hidden trash folder.
- Metadata about the deleted file is stored in a SQLite database called `trash.db`.
- This database is typically located at:
  /data/user/<userid>/com.samsung.android.providers.trash/databases/trash.db

The `trash.db` file contains a table (usually named `trashes`) with columns like:

- `title`: the original filename of the deleted image
- `date_deleted`: the timestamp (in Unix epoch milliseconds) when the file was deleted

However, this database alone does not contain full metadata about the image itself ‚Äî such as when it was taken or which device captured it.

üîç What This Tool Adds
----------------------
Trashes Panda enhances the raw database by:

1. üß† Parsing timestamps from the `title` field  
   - Recognizes formats like `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`, `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`, and Unix timestamps
   - Converts them into human-readable local time

2. üì∏ Extracting EXIF metadata from image files  
   - Reads the `DateTimeOriginal` tag to determine when the photo was taken
   - Extracts the `Model` tag to identify the camera or device used

3. üßæ Enriching the database with:
   - `converted_title`: parsed timestamp from filename
   - `exif_created`: timestamp from EXIF metadata
   - `file_type`: file extension (e.g. jpg, png)
   - `file_path`: full path to the matched image
   - `camera_model`: device model from EXIF

4. üì§ Exporting all enriched data to a CSV file (`output.csv`) for analysis

üñ•Ô∏è How to Use
--------------
1. Launch the GUI by running:
   python trashes_panda_gui.py

2. Click "Browse" and select a folder containing ZIP files extracted from an Android device.

3. The tool will:
   - Scan each ZIP for a valid `trash.db` and image files
   - Extract and process the data
   - Output a file called `output.csv` in the same directory

üìÑ Output Columns
-----------------
| Column               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Original Title       | Filename from the trash.db                       |
| Extracted Timestamps | Parsed from filename (if available)              |
| EXIF Created         | Timestamp from EXIF metadata                     |
| File Type            | File extension (e.g. jpg, png)                   |
| Camera Model         | Device model from EXIF metadata                  |
| Unixepoch Timestamp  | Deletion time from trash.db (raw)                |
| Deleted_CST          | Deletion time converted to local time            |
| File Path            | Path to the matched image file                   |

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
---------------
- Python 3.7+
- Pillow (for EXIF parsing):
  pip install pillow

üì¶ Optional: Bundle as .exe
---------------------------
You can use PyInstaller to create a standalone Windows executable:

  pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=panda.ico trashes_panda_gui.py

üß™ Forensic Use Cases
---------------------
- Recover deleted photo metadata from Android devices
- Correlate deletion times with original capture times
- Identify the device used to take a photo
- Audit user activity from extracted backups
